# Predictive-modelling-of-RNA-Splicing-variance-using-AI

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a project focused on the **predictive modelling of RNA Splicing variance** [1] using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The primary biological context for this work is **Alternative Splicing** [2].

The aim is to develop robust computational models capable of predicting variations or outcomes related to RNA splicing based on input data.

## Technology Stack

The project is implemented entirely in **Python** [2].

| Component | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Language** | Python (100.0%) [2] |
| **Core Methodology** | Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Predictive Modelling [1] |

## Repository Structure

## Getting Started

*(Note: Specific installation and usage instructions are not available in the sources, but general steps are provided below.)*

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kesavadatta2410/Predictive-modelling-of-RNA-Splicing-variance-using-AI.git
    cd Predictive-modelling-of-RNA-Splicing-variance-using-AI
    ```
2.  **Set up Environment:**
    Ensure required dependencies are installed using the configuration files (`pyproject.toml` or similar lock files).
3.  **Run the Pipeline:**
    Execute the main script to start the predictive modelling process.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
